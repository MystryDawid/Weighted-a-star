# Weighted a star
While coding weighted a star, path finder algorithm I have learned python OOP. I also make binary tree for better performance. 


This aStar take as input size, difficulty (from 0 to 100), e (from 0 to 100) if e is small algorithm is taking longer but it returns better path in the opposite case algorithm is fast, but path isn't the best. 

Return the path (position x and y of every node of path) or false if the path was not found, maze, each node that was in the open set and for how long algorithm was working.
