# Weighted a star
While programing weighted a star path finder algorithm i have learned python OOP


This aStar take as input size, difficulty (from 0 to 100), e (from 0 to 100) if e is small algorithm is taking longer but it return better path in the opposite case algorithm is fast but path isn't the best. 

Return the path (position x and y of every node of path) or false if the path was not found, maze, each node that was in the open set and how long algorithm was working.
